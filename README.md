Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software applications and systems through writing computer codes.  
Software engineering is important because without it, the creation of software applications and systems that makes life easier would not be possible.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1) The development of programming languages : This means new languages were created to help people write computer codes more easily.
2) The development of Software engineering as a field of study: This means Software engineering became a recorgnised area of study and work.
3) The beginning of srtuctured programming : This means an organised method of programming was introduced.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) Requirements : This means finding out what the user and system needs.
2) Design : This means creating high-level details of how the software will work.
3) Implementation : This means writing the code and building the software according to the design created.
4) Testing : This means checking if the software meets qaulity standards and fixing errors if it doesn't.
5) Deployment : This means releasing the software to users.
6) Maintenance : This means updating the software to keep it running smoothly after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Similarity : They are both software development methodologies which aim to deliver working software applications and systems.
Differences : Waterfall method's approach is sequential while Agile method's approach is iterative and incremental.
Waterfall method would be appropriate when developing software projects for safety-critical systems like medical devices.
Agile method would be appropriate when developing software projects that rapidly change.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer : writes computer codes and builds software applications and systems.
Quality Assurance Engineer : ensures software quality and runs test on software projects.
Project Manager : is responsible for the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are important in software development processes because they provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing computer codes. Examples are Visual studio, Eclipse. 
Version Control Systems are important in software development processes because they provide software tools used for tracking changes to source codes and coordinating work among team members. Examples are Git, Subversion. 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1) Tight deadlines : The strategy in which Software Engineers can use to overcome this challenge is by prioritizing thier tasks at hand and avoiding distractions.
2) Changing requirements :  The strategy in which Software Engineers can use to overcome this challenge is by communicating regularly and clarifyinly to customers throughout development processes

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1) Unit : This involves testing individual components of code to ensure they work correctly. It is important because it ensures code quality.
2) Integration : This involves testing how different units of code work together to ensure they integrate correctly. It is important because it helps to identify issues with how different components interact.
3) System : This involves testing the entire software system to ensure it meets requirements and works as expected. It is important because it helps to ensure that the software is stable and meets customer needs. 
4) Acceptance : This involves testing the software to ensure it meets the requirements and expectations of users. It is important because it helps to ensure that the software is usable and that it also provides value to users. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering can be defined as the formulation of questions, statements and instructions given to AI models to get the best possible responses from them. 
One of the importance of prompt engineering when it comes to interracting with AI models is that it makes your questions clear and specific so that the AI model can understand exactly what you need.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt : Tell me something about software engineering
Improved Prompt : Tell me the history of how software engineering first became a recorgnised area of study.
The improved prompt is more effective because I have given the AI model a clear, specific and curious question which it understands and in return, I'll get a more focused response from it.
